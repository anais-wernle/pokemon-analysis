The goal of this analysis is to give insights about legendary pokemons (most commons types*, statistics** ...) and to build our first machine learning model to predict if any pokemon in a pokedex is a legendary pokemon. 

In each pokemon game, the most difficult pokemons to catch are the legendary ones (as you can catch them only once) and are generally featured in the legends and myths of the Pokémon world.

We will use a classification machine learning model called KNN to determine if each pokemon is legendary or not.
